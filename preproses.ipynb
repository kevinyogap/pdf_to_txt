      "visited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \n",

      "the problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \n",
      "itinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \n",
      "lack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \n",
      "then he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \n",
      "by  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \n",
      "mapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \n",
      "Moreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \n",

      " INTRODUCTION \n",
      "\n",
      "Itinerary is a planned route or journey. For travelers, travel \n",
      "itinerary  usually  contains  a  schedule of  intended  destinations \n",
      "and  activities.  After  selecting  the  tourist  destinations  to  be \n",
      "visited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \n",
      "itinerary) becomes the next challenging problem to be solved. \n",
      "\n",
      "The  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  is  unstructured  in \n",
      "real  life,  which  means  goals,  decision  criteria  and  other \n",
      "constrains  of \n",
      "to  completely \n",
      "the  problem  are  unable \n",
      "predefined [1]. However, we can identify and define some of \n",
      "the problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \n",
      "itinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \n",
      "lack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \n",
      "then he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \n",
      "by  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \n",
      "mapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \n",
      "Moreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \n",
      "in  the  destination  city,  then  he/she  must  also  determine  the \n",
      "schedule of tourist visits for each day. \n",
      "\n",
      " Recent  years,  many  computer-based  applications  are \n",
      "utilizing  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Russell  and  Norvig  [2] \n",
      "categorized  the  definitions  of  AI  into  four  categories: \n",
      "\n",
      "systems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, \n",
      "systems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally. \n",
      "Some  of  the  problems  that  are  often  solved  using  AI  is \n",
      "optimization  and  decision  making  problem.  The  travel \n",
      "itinerary planning problem is one of the problems included in \n",
      "that category. Therefore, in this research, we will develop an \n",
      "application  to  solve  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem \n",
      "using artificial intelligence approach. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, the developed application should be able to \n",
      "provide  an  optimal  itinerary  recommendation  in  terms  of \n",
      "distance  and  travel  time.  We  use  initial  assumption  that  the \n",
      "traveler  has  determined  all  the  tourist  destinations  he/she \n",
      "wants to visit and also the number of days he/she will stay in \n",
      "the region. There are two sub-issues to solve. The first is how \n",
      "to cluster the tourist destinations that will be visited for each \n",
      "day. While the second is how to arrange the order of visits on \n",
      "a  daily  basis  so  that  the  total  travel  distance  will  be \n",
      "minimum. \n",
      "\n",
      "The  problem  of  grouping  the  visited  tourist  destinations \n",
      "in each day can be solved by employing k-means clustering, \n",
      "where  the  nearby  tourist  destinations  will  be  grouped  to  be \n",
      "visited  on  the  same  day.  While  the  problem  of  optimization \n",
      "of  the  visit  order (tour  arrangement)  can  be  solved  by  using \n",
      "the traveling salesman problem (TSP) approach. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "TSP  can  simply  be  stated  as:  if  a  traveling  salesman \n",
      " cities (where \n",
      "wishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \n",
      "the  cost  of  traveling  from  city \n",
      ")  and  then \n",
      "return  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \n",
      "traveling salesman can take? [3]. In this study, salesman can \n",
      "be  analogized  as  a  traveler  and  the  visited  cities  are  tourist \n",
      "destinations  in a region. We use Yogyakarta city, one of the \n",
      "tourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \n",
      "proposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \n",
      "With the technique proposed in this study, it is expected that \n",
      "the  application  prototype  will  be  able  to  help  traveler  in \n",

Traveling Salesman Problem \\n\\nin  graph \\n\\nTraveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  one  of  the  most \\nfamous  problems \\ntheory  and  combinatorics. \\nMathematical  problems  related  to  the  TSP  were  firstly \\nintroduced  in  the  1800s  by  the  Irish  mathematician  Sir \\nWilliam  Rowan  Hamilton  and  by  the  British  mathematician \\nThomas  Penyngton  Kirkman  [4].  TSP  is  an  optimization \\nproblem and can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\n)  and  then \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. According to graph theory, \\ncity  can  be  represented  as  a  graph  node,  while  the  road that \\nconnects between two cities can be represented as edge. The \\nedge's weight represents the distance between two cities. TSP \\nis  none  other than  determining  the  Hamilton  circuit that  has \\nthe  minimum  weight  on  a  connected  graph.  The  Hamilton \\ncircuit itself is a closed path that pass each node/vertex in the \\ngraph exactly once, except the origin node (which is also the \\nfinal node) that is passed twice. \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  vertices \\n\\nComputationally,  TSP  has  high  time  complexity.  In  any \\ncomplete  graph  with \\n,  the  number  of \\n. We can imagine if \\ndifferent Hamilton circuits is \\nthe  number  of  vertices  to  be  visited  are  very  huge, the  time \\nneeded  to  evaluate  the  possible  solutions  (to obtain  the  best \\nsolution)  will  be  very \\nlong.  Therefore,  beside  using \\ndeterministic  methods,  many  studies  have  developed \\nmethods  for  solving  TSP  using  heuristic  methods  such  as \\ngenetic algorithms [5][6] or swarm intelligence [7][8]. \\n\\nIn  a  case  of  TSP  with  small  number  of  vertices,  a  brute \\nforce (exhaustive enumeration) approach can be used to find \\nthe  order  of  visits  with  a  minimum  total  distance.  Figure  1 \\nshows an example of a TSP case with 4 vertices and also the \\nsolution using brute force method. \\n\\nFig.\",\n",

K-means algorithm is one of \\nthe  non-hierarchical  clustering  methods  that  can  group  data \\ninto  several  groups  based  on  similarity  of  data.  This \\nmechanism  allows  data  that  have  the  same  characteristics \\ngrouped  into  one  cluster  and  data  that  have  different \\ncharacteristics grouped in other clusters. \\n\\nthat  can  be  used \\n\\nTo  determine  the  cluster  label  of  the  data,  the  distance \\nbetween data with each cluster center is calculated. There are \\nto  perform  distance \\nseveral  ways \\ncalculations, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, \\nand  Chebichey  distance.  The  k-means  method  aims  to \\nminimize  the  sum  of  squares  of  distance  between  all  data \\npoints  with  the  center  of  each  cluster.  The  procedure  of  k-\\nmeans consists of the following steps, as described in [9]. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 1: Select \\n\\n out of the given \\ncluster  centers.

       " '2. \\n\\nK': '2. \\n\\nK-means  algorithm  has  several  advantages  such  as \\nsimple, fast, and easy to implement. Nevertheless, the output \\nof  k-means  relies  heavily  on  a  randomly  determined  initial \\ncentroid.  Therefore,  in  practical  applications  k-means  must \\nbe  run  several  times  with  different  initial  centroids  to \\nproduce the final centroid that is considered the best. \\n\\nC.  Preview on Travel Itinerary Planning Application \\n\\nWith  the  growing  capabilities  in  technology  nowadays, \\nthere  are  many  research  and  applications  to  facilitate  the \\ntravelers  [10].  Most  of  them  are  applications  that  provide \\nrecommendations  and  reviews  about  destinations  of  interest \\nto  visit,  such  as  TripAdvisor  application.  There  are  still \\nrarely founded applications that can be used where the case is \\nuser has determined the destinations that he/she wants to visit \\nand  begin  to  arrange  or  schedule  the  order  automatically. \\nUsually  the  prospective  travelers  must  arrange  their  own \\nschedule  and  then  record  it  in  the  applications  that  can  help \\nthem keep the itinerary records. \\n\\nBased  on  references  found  on  the  Internet,  one  of  the \\nitinerary  planner  application  is  Eightydays  which  is  an \\napplication that helps travelers to design a travel plan to visit \\nseveral  cities  in  Europe  [11].  This  app  gives  tourists  some \\navailable  options  when  going  on  a  trip  to  Europe.  The  app \\ndeveloper  realizes  that  arranging  travel  plan  manually  is \\nusually  time  consuming.  By  using  Eightydays,  user  only \\nneeds to enter a city where the journey will begin and finish. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThen  user  must  also  enter the  date of  departure, duration  of \\ntravel  and  the  number  of  cities  they  want  to  visit.  The  app \\nitinerary  along  with  flight \\nwill  automatically  generate \\ninformation and accommodation information in each city. \\n\\nEightydays  is  considered  as  macro  planner,  which  plans \\nvisit to several cities. Whereas in one city alone tourists still \\nneed to make  itinerary. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to develop \\nadditional  applications  that  can  solve  this  problem,  so  that \\nprospective travelers no longer spend a lot of time to design \\nan efficient itinerary. \\n\\ntour  planner  system \\n\\nAnother  more  sophisticated \\n\\nis \\nDynamic Tour Guide (DTG) [12]. Points of interest in DTG \\nare called as Tour Building Blocks (TBBs) and described by \\nontology.  DTG  calculates  the  similarity  between  TBBs  and \\nuser  profile  to  select  which  point of  interest the user  should \\nvisit during his/her stay. In our approach, the user can select \\nthe  points  of  interest  which  he/she  wish  to  visit,  then  the \\npoints of interest will be clustered for each day planning. \\n\\nIII.  METHODOLOGY \\n\\nIn  this  study,  we  choose  Yogyakarta  city,  one  of  the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nYogyakarta  has  a  lot  of  tourism  destinations.  Moreover, \\nbased  on  statistical  data  of  Yogyakarta  Province  Tourism \\nOffice [13], the number of tourists continues to increase from \\n2012 to 2016, as can be seen in Figure',\n",

Finally,  to  facilitate  the  documentation,  user  can  save \\nand  download  the  results of  the  itinerary  design  in  the  form \\nof a .pdf file. \\n\\nIn  this  experiment,  we  tried  to  calculate  and  analyze  the \\nprocessing time of the application. For each scenario, we run \\nit  three  times  then  calculated  the  average  value  of  the \\nprocessing time. Although the scenario is same, the length of \\nprocessing time may vary as it is influenced by several factors \\nsuch  as  internet  connection  speed,  memory,  and  also  server \\nprocessor  speed.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \\n\\nIn  this  paper,  traveling  salesman  problem  and  k-means \\nclustering approach has been applied to develop an automatic \\ntravel \\nitinerary  planning  application.  By  using  our \\napplication,  it  can  help  traveler  in  arranging  a  smart  travel \\nitinerary,  which  is  efficient  in  terms  of  distance  and  travel \\ntime.  However,  we  realize  that  this  application  still  need \\nmany  improvement,  since  the  goals,  decision  criteria  and \\nother  constrains  of  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  are \\nunable  to  completely  predefined.  In  the  future,  in  order  to \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cimprove our algorithm, we plan to conduct User Acceptance \\nTesting to gather feedback from prospective user. \\n\\nproblem.

       " 'INTRODUCTION': 'INTRODUCTION \\n\\nItinerary is a planned route or journey. For travelers, travel \\nitinerary  usually  contains  a  schedule of  intended  destinations \\nand  activities.  After  selecting  the  tourist  destinations  to  be \\nvisited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \\nitinerary) becomes the next challenging problem to be solved. \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  is  unstructured  in \\nreal  life,  which  means  goals,  decision  criteria  and  other \\nconstrains  of \\nto  completely \\nthe  problem  are  unable \\npredefined [1]. However, we can identify and define some of \\nthe problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \\nitinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \\nlack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \\nthen he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \\nby  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \\nmapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \\nMoreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \\nin  the  destination  city,  then  he/she  must  also  determine  the \\nschedule of tourist visits for each day. \\n\\n Recent  years,  many  computer-based  applications  are \\nutilizing  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Russell  and  Norvig  [2] \\ncategorized  the  definitions  of  AI  into  four  categories: \\n\\nsystems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, \\nsystems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally. \\nSome  of  the  problems  that  are  often  solved  using  AI  is \\noptimization  and  decision  making  problem.  The  travel \\nitinerary planning problem is one of the problems included in \\nthat category. Therefore, in this research, we will develop an \\napplication  to  solve  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem \\nusing artificial intelligence approach. \\n\\nIn this study, the developed application should be able to \\nprovide  an  optimal  itinerary  recommendation  in  terms  of \\ndistance  and  travel  time.  We  use  initial  assumption  that  the \\ntraveler  has  determined  all  the  tourist  destinations  he/she \\nwants to visit and also the number of days he/she will stay in \\nthe region. There are two sub-issues to solve. The first is how \\nto cluster the tourist destinations that will be visited for each \\nday. While the second is how to arrange the order of visits on \\na  daily  basis  so  that  the  total  travel  distance  will  be \\nminimum. \\n\\nThe  problem  of  grouping  the  visited  tourist  destinations \\nin each day can be solved by employing k-means clustering, \\nwhere  the  nearby  tourist  destinations  will  be  grouped  to  be \\nvisited  on  the  same  day.

Traveling Salesman Problem \\n\\nin  graph \\n\\nTraveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  one  of  the  most \\nfamous  problems \\ntheory  and  combinatorics. \\nMathematical  problems  related  to  the  TSP  were  firstly \\nintroduced  in  the  1800s  by  the  Irish  mathematician  Sir \\nWilliam  Rowan  Hamilton  and  by  the  British  mathematician \\nThomas  Penyngton  Kirkman  [4].  TSP  is  an  optimization \\nproblem and can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\n)  and  then \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. According to graph theory, \\ncity  can  be  represented  as  a  graph  node,  while  the  road that \\nconnects between two cities can be represented as edge. The \\nedge's weight represents the distance between two cities. TSP \\nis  none  other than  determining  the  Hamilton  circuit that  has \\nthe  minimum  weight  on  a  connected  graph.  The  Hamilton \\ncircuit itself is a closed path that pass each node/vertex in the \\ngraph exactly once, except the origin node (which is also the \\nfinal node) that is passed twice. \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  vertices \\n\\nComputationally,  TSP  has  high  time  complexity.  In  any \\ncomplete  graph  with \\n,  the  number  of \\n. We can imagine if \\ndifferent Hamilton circuits is \\nthe  number  of  vertices  to  be  visited  are  very  huge, the  time \\nneeded  to  evaluate  the  possible  solutions  (to obtain  the  best \\nsolution)  will  be  very \\nlong.  Therefore,  beside  using \\ndeterministic  methods,  many  studies  have  developed \\nmethods  for  solving  TSP  using  heuristic  methods  such  as \\ngenetic algorithms [5][6] or swarm intelligence [7][8]. \\n\\nIn  a  case  of  TSP  with  small  number  of  vertices,  a  brute \\nforce (exhaustive enumeration) approach can be used to find \\nthe  order  of  visits  with  a  minimum  total  distance.  Figure  1 \\nshows an example of a TSP case with 4 vertices and also the \\nsolution using brute force method. \\n\\nFig. 1. The example of TSP \\n\\nB.  K-Means Clustering \\n\\nK-means  is  an  algorithm  used  for  clustering  which  will \\ndivide data into several groups. K-means algorithm is one of \\nthe  non-hierarchical  clustering  methods  that  can  group  data \\ninto  several  groups  based  on  similarity  of  data.  This \\nmechanism  allows  data  that  have  the  same  characteristics \\ngrouped  into  one  cluster  and  data  that  have  different \\ncharacteristics grouped in other clusters. \\n\\nthat  can  be  used \\n\\nTo  determine  the  cluster  label  of  the  data,  the  distance \\nbetween data with each cluster center is calculated. There are \\nto  perform  distance \\nseveral  ways \\ncalculations, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, \\nand  Chebichey  distance.  The  k-means  method  aims  to \\nminimize  the  sum  of  squares  of  distance  between  all  data \\npoints  with  the  center  of  each  cluster.  The  procedure  of  k-\\nmeans consists of the following steps, as described in [9]. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 1: Select \\n\\n out of the given \\ncluster  centers.  Assign  each  of  the  remaining \\npatterns to one of the \\nits closest center/cluster. \\n\\n clusters; a pattern is assigned to \\n\\n patterns as the initial \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 2: Compute the cluster centers based on the current \\n\\nassignment of patterns. \\n\\uf0b7  Step  3:  Assign  each  of  the \\n\\ncenter/cluster. \\n\\n  patterns  to  its  closest \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step  4:  If  there  is  no  change  in  the  assignment  of \\npatterns  to  clusters  during  two  successive  iterations, \\nthen stop; else, go to Step 2. \\n\\nK-means  algorithm  has  several  advantages  such  as \\nsimple, fast, and easy to implement. Nevertheless, the output \\nof  k-means  relies  heavily  on  a  randomly  determined  initial \\ncentroid.  Therefore,  in  practical  applications  k-means  must \\nbe  run  several  times  with  different  initial  centroids  to \\nproduce the final centroid that is considered the best. \\n\\nC.  Preview on Travel Itinerary Planning Application \\n\\nWith  the  growing  capabilities  in  technology  nowadays, \\nthere  are  many  research  and  applications  to  facilitate  the \\ntravelers  [10].  Most  of  them  are  applications  that  provide \\nrecommendations  and  reviews  about  destinations  of  interest \\nto  visit,  such  as  TripAdvisor  application.  There  are  still \\nrarely founded applications that can be used where the case is \\nuser has determined the destinations that he/she wants to visit \\nand  begin  to  arrange  or  schedule  the  order  automatically. \\nUsually  the  prospective  travelers  must  arrange  their  own \\nschedule  and  then  record  it  in  the  applications  that  can  help \\nthem keep the itinerary records. \\n\\nBased  on  references  found  on  the  Internet,  one  of  the \\nitinerary  planner  application  is  Eightydays  which  is  an \\napplication that helps travelers to design a travel plan to visit \\nseveral  cities  in  Europe  [11].  This  app  gives  tourists  some \\navailable  options  when  going  on  a  trip  to  Europe.  The  app \\ndeveloper  realizes  that  arranging  travel  plan  manually  is \\nusually  time  consuming.  By  using  Eightydays,  user  only \\nneeds to enter a city where the journey will begin and finish. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThen  user  must  also  enter the  date of  departure, duration  of \\ntravel  and  the  number  of  cities  they  want  to  visit.  The  app \\nitinerary  along  with  flight \\nwill  automatically  generate \\ninformation and accommodation information in each city. \\n\\nEightydays  is  considered  as  macro  planner,  which  plans \\nvisit to several cities. Whereas in one city alone tourists still \\nneed to make  itinerary. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to develop \\nadditional  applications  that  can  solve  this  problem,  so  that \\nprospective travelers no longer spend a lot of time to design \\nan efficient itinerary. \\n\\ntour  planner  system \\n\\nAnother  more  sophisticated \\n\\nis \\nDynamic Tour Guide (DTG) [12]. Points of interest in DTG \\nare called as Tour Building Blocks (TBBs) and described by \\nontology.  DTG  calculates  the  similarity  between  TBBs  and \\nuser  profile  to  select  which  point of  interest the user  should \\nvisit during his/her stay. In our approach, the user can select \\nthe  points  of  interest  which  he/she  wish  to  visit,  then  the \\npoints of interest will be clustered for each day planning. \\n\\nIII.\",\n",
       " 'METHODOLOGY': 'METHODOLOGY \\n\\nIn  this  study,  we  choose  Yogyakarta  city,  one  of  the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nYogyakarta  has  a  lot  of  tourism  destinations.  Moreover, \\nbased  on  statistical  data  of  Yogyakarta  Province  Tourism \\nOffice [13], the number of tourists continues to increase from \\n2012 to 2016, as can be seen in Figure 2. This trend indicates \\nthat  in  the  future  Yogyakarta  will  attract  more travelers.  To \\nencourage  the  development  of  Yogyakarta  as  a  tourist \\ndestination, \\nthe \\ngovernment  but  also  by  the  creative  industry  sector  such  as \\nsoftware industry. \\n\\nit  should  be  supported  not  only  by \\n\\nFig. 2. Statistical data of tourists visiting Yogyakarta from 2012 to 2016. \\n\\nPrior  to  modeling  the  system,  we  performed  a  system \\nrequirement  analysis.  We  identify  some  inputs  required  by \\nthe  application.  They  are  the  number  of  days  desired  for  a \\nvacation,  the  starting  location  of  the  trip  and  also  the \\ndestination  locations  that  user  wants  to  visit.  In  this  initial \\nversion of the app, it is assumed that the initial  location and \\nthe  final  location  of  the  trip  are  the  same,  which  is  in \\n\\naccordance with the TSP concept. This location can be filled \\nwith  the  address  where  user  will  stay  in  the  tourist \\ndestination  city.  The  app  will  also  provide  a  list  of  tourist \\ndestination  locations  (points  of  interest)  that  can  be  visited, \\nso user only needs to choose from the existing list. In making \\nthis application, the database  for the list of points of  interest \\nis taken from YogYes.com which is a website travel portal to \\nYogyakarta. \\n\\nThe  system  framework  is  presented  in  Figure  3.  Our \\napproach  consists  of  two  main  modules,  the  first  one  is \\nclustering  module  using  k-means  method.  All  destination \\nlocations  preferred  by  user  will  be  grouped  into \\n  cluster \\nwith  the  number  of \\n  equals  with  the  number  of  vacation \\ndays.  Second  one  is  finding  TSP  solution  using  all  possible \\npermutations. \\n\\nFig. 3. Framework System  \\n\\nSome  processes  that  need  to  be  done  by  the  application \\nare the  process of  accessing  the  location  that the user  wants \\nas  the  initial  location  of  the  itinerary,  the  process  of \\ndisplaying the list of points of interest, the process of making \\nitinerary, and the process of displaying itinerary result. In the \\nend, user can download the itinerary result in the form of .pdf \\nfile  in  order  to  make  it  easier  to  print  or  save  the  itinerary \\nresult on other devices. \\n\\nThe next step is modeling the system. System modeling is \\nmade  using  flowchart  diagram  to  describe  the  algorithm  or \\nthe  steps  of  problem  solving.  The  general  system  flowchart \\ncan be seen in Figure 3. \\n\\nFigure  4  illustrates  the  flow  of  the  travel  itinerary \\nplanning  application.  The  process  begins  by  entering  the \\nnumber of vacation days, the starting location of the trip and \\nthe  destination  locations  to  be  visited.  After  system  gets  the \\ninputs, the next step is to make the itinerary. The final step is \\nto display the travel itinerary recommendation based on TSP \\nsolution  approach  and  k-means  clustering.  The  process  of \\n“make itinerary” is described in more detail in Figure 4. \\n\\nFigure 5 shows the detail process for getting a travel route. \\nFirst of all, start by grouping the tourist destination locations \\nby  day.  This  grouping  uses  k-means  clustering  algorithm, \\nwhere  the  number  of  days  on  vacation  will  be  used  as  the \\nvalue  of  k  (number  of  clusters).  With  k-means  clustering \\ntechnique, the  nearby tourist destinations will  be  grouped to \\nbe visited on the same day. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cthat  has  the  smallest  total  distance  for  each  cluster.

       " 'INTRODUCTION': 'INTRODUCTION \\n\\nItinerary is a planned route or journey. For travelers, travel \\nitinerary  usually  contains  a  schedule of  intended  destinations \\nand  activities.  After  selecting  the  tourist  destinations  to  be \\nvisited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \\nitinerary) becomes the next challenging problem to be solved. \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  is  unstructured  in \\nreal  life,  which  means  goals,  decision  criteria  and  other \\nconstrains  of \\nto  completely \\nthe  problem  are  unable \\npredefined [1]. However, we can identify and define some of \\nthe problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \\nitinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \\nlack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \\nthen he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \\nby  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \\nmapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \\nMoreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \\nin  the  destination  city,  then  he/she  must  also  determine  the \\nschedule of tourist visits for each day. \\n\\n Recent  years,  many  computer-based  applications  are \\nutilizing  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Russell  and  Norvig  [2] \\ncategorized  the  definitions  of  AI  into  four  categories: \\n\\nsystems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, \\nsystems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally. \\nSome  of  the  problems  that  are  often  solved  using  AI  is \\noptimization  and  decision  making  problem.  The  travel \\nitinerary planning problem is one of the problems included in \\nthat category. Therefore, in this research, we will develop an \\napplication  to  solve  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem \\nusing artificial intelligence approach. \\n\\nIn this study, the developed application should be able to \\nprovide  an  optimal  itinerary  recommendation  in  terms  of \\ndistance  and  travel  time.  We  use  initial  assumption  that  the \\ntraveler  has  determined  all  the  tourist  destinations  he/she \\nwants to visit and also the number of days he/she will stay in \\nthe region. There are two sub-issues to solve. The first is how \\nto cluster the tourist destinations that will be visited for each \\nday. While the second is how to arrange the order of visits on \\na  daily  basis  so  that  the  total  travel  distance  will  be \\nminimum. \\n\\nThe  problem  of  grouping  the  visited  tourist  destinations \\nin each day can be solved by employing k-means clustering, \\nwhere  the  nearby  tourist  destinations  will  be  grouped  to  be \\nvisited  on  the  same  day.  While  the  problem  of  optimization \\nof  the  visit  order (tour  arrangement)  can  be  solved  by  using \\nthe traveling salesman problem (TSP) approach. \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\nTSP  can  simply  be  stated  as:  if  a  traveling  salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\n)  and  then \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. In this study, salesman can \\nbe  analogized  as  a  traveler  and  the  visited  cities  are  tourist \\ndestinations  in a region. We use Yogyakarta city, one of the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nWith the technique proposed in this study, it is expected that \\nthe  application  prototype  will  be  able  to  help  traveler  in \\narranging a better travel  itinerary, which  is  more efficient  in \\nterms of distance and travel time. \\n\\nThe  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.

       " 'PRELIMINARIES': \"PRELIMINARIES \\n\\nA.  Traveling Salesman Problem \\n\\nin  graph \\n\\nTraveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  one  of  the  most \\nfamous  problems \\ntheory  and  combinatorics. \\nMathematical  problems  related  to  the  TSP  were  firstly \\nintroduced  in  the  1800s  by  the  Irish  mathematician  Sir \\nWilliam  Rowan  Hamilton  and  by  the  British  mathematician \\nThomas  Penyngton  Kirkman  [4].  TSP  is  an  optimization \\nproblem and can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\n)  and  then \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. According to graph theory, \\ncity  can  be  represented  as  a  graph  node,  while  the  road that \\nconnects between two cities can be represented as edge. The \\nedge's weight represents the distance between two cities. TSP \\nis  none  other than  determining  the  Hamilton  circuit that  has \\nthe  minimum  weight  on  a  connected  graph.  The  Hamilton \\ncircuit itself is a closed path that pass each node/vertex in the \\ngraph exactly once, except the origin node (which is also the \\nfinal node) that is passed twice. \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  vertices \\n\\nComputationally,  TSP  has  high  time  complexity.  In  any \\ncomplete  graph  with \\n,  the  number  of \\n. We can imagine if \\ndifferent Hamilton circuits is \\nthe  number  of  vertices  to  be  visited  are  very  huge, the  time \\nneeded  to  evaluate  the  possible  solutions  (to obtain  the  best \\nsolution)  will  be  very \\nlong.  Therefore,  beside  using \\ndeterministic  methods,  many  studies  have  developed \\nmethods  for  solving  TSP  using  heuristic  methods  such  as \\ngenetic algorithms [5][6] or swarm intelligence [7][8]. \\n\\nIn  a  case  of  TSP  with  small  number  of  vertices,  a  brute \\nforce (exhaustive enumeration) approach can be used to find \\nthe  order  of  visits  with  a  minimum  total  distance.  Figure  1 \\nshows an example of a TSP case with 4 vertices and also the \\nsolution using brute force method. \\n\\nFig. 1. The example of TSP \\n\\nB.  K-Means Clustering \\n\\nK-means  is  an  algorithm  used  for  clustering  which  will \\ndivide data into several groups. K-means algorithm is one of \\nthe  non-hierarchical  clustering  methods  that  can  group  data \\ninto  several  groups  based  on  similarity  of  data.  This \\nmechanism  allows  data  that  have  the  same  characteristics \\ngrouped  into  one  cluster  and  data  that  have  different \\ncharacteristics grouped in other clusters. \\n\\nthat  can  be  used \\n\\nTo  determine  the  cluster  label  of  the  data,  the  distance \\nbetween data with each cluster center is calculated. There are \\nto  perform  distance \\nseveral  ways \\ncalculations, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, \\nand  Chebichey  distance.  The  k-means  method  aims  to \\nminimize  the  sum  of  squares  of  distance  between  all  data \\npoints  with  the  center  of  each  cluster.  The  procedure  of  k-\\nmeans consists of the following steps, as described in [9]. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 1: Select \\n\\n out of the given \\ncluster  centers.  Assign  each  of  the  remaining \\npatterns to one of the \\nits closest center/cluster. \\n\\n clusters; a pattern is assigned to \\n\\n patterns as the initial \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 2: Compute the cluster centers based on the current \\n\\nassignment of patterns. \\n\\uf0b7  Step  3:  Assign  each  of  the \\n\\ncenter/cluster. \\n\\n  patterns  to  its  closest \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step  4:  If  there  is  no  change  in  the  assignment  of \\npatterns  to  clusters  during  two  successive  iterations, \\nthen stop; else, go to Step 2. \\n\\nK-means  algorithm  has  several  advantages  such  as \\nsimple, fast, and easy to implement. Nevertheless, the output \\nof  k-means  relies  heavily  on  a  randomly  determined  initial \\ncentroid.  Therefore,  in  practical  applications  k-means  must \\nbe  run  several  times  with  different  initial  centroids  to \\nproduce the final centroid that is considered the best. \\n\\nC.  Preview on Travel Itinerary Planning Application \\n\\nWith  the  growing  capabilities  in  technology  nowadays, \\nthere  are  many  research  and  applications  to  facilitate  the \\ntravelers  [10].  Most  of  them  are  applications  that  provide \\nrecommendations  and  reviews  about  destinations  of  interest \\nto  visit,  such  as  TripAdvisor  application.  There  are  still \\nrarely founded applications that can be used where the case is \\nuser has determined the destinations that he/she wants to visit \\nand  begin  to  arrange  or  schedule  the  order  automatically. \\nUsually  the  prospective  travelers  must  arrange  their  own \\nschedule  and  then  record  it  in  the  applications  that  can  help \\nthem keep the itinerary records. \\n\\nBased  on  references  found  on  the  Internet,  one  of  the \\nitinerary  planner  application  is  Eightydays  which  is  an \\napplication that helps travelers to design a travel plan to visit \\nseveral  cities  in  Europe  [11].  This  app  gives  tourists  some \\navailable  options  when  going  on  a  trip  to  Europe.  The  app \\ndeveloper  realizes  that  arranging  travel  plan  manually  is \\nusually  time  consuming.  By  using  Eightydays,  user  only \\nneeds to enter a city where the journey will begin and finish. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThen  user  must  also  enter the  date of  departure, duration  of \\ntravel  and  the  number  of  cities  they  want  to  visit.  The  app \\nitinerary  along  with  flight \\nwill  automatically  generate \\ninformation and accommodation information in each city. \\n\\nEightydays  is  considered  as  macro  planner,  which  plans \\nvisit to several cities. Whereas in one city alone tourists still \\nneed to make  itinerary. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to develop \\nadditional  applications  that  can  solve  this  problem,  so  that \\nprospective travelers no longer spend a lot of time to design \\nan efficient itinerary. \\n\\ntour  planner  system \\n\\nAnother  more  sophisticated \\n\\nis \\nDynamic Tour Guide (DTG) [12].

In our approach, the user can select \\nthe  points  of  interest  which  he/she  wish  to  visit,  then  the \\npoints of interest will be clustered for each day planning. \\n\\nIII.\",\n",
       " 'METHODOLOGY': 'METHODOLOGY \\n\\nIn  this  study,  we  choose  Yogyakarta  city,  one  of  the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nYogyakarta  has  a  lot  of  tourism  destinations.

For travelers, travel \\nitinerary  usually  contains  a  schedule of  intended  destinations \\nand  activities.  After  selecting  the  tourist  destinations  to  be \\nvisited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \\nitinerary) becomes the next challenging problem to be solved. \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  is  unstructured  in \\nreal  life,  which  means  goals,  decision  criteria  and  other \\nconstrains  of \\nto  completely \\nthe  problem  are  unable \\npredefined [1]. However, we can identify and define some of \\nthe problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \\nitinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \\nlack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \\nthen he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \\nby  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \\nmapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \\nMoreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \\nin  the  destination  city,  then  he/she  must  also  determine  the \\nschedule of tourist visits for each day. \\n\\n Recent  years,  many  computer-based  applications  are \\nutilizing  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Russell  and  Norvig  [2] \\ncategorized  the  definitions  of  AI  into  four  categories: \\n\\nsystems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, \\nsystems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally. \\nSome  of  the  problems  that  are  often  solved  using  AI  is \\noptimization  and  decision  making  problem.  The  travel \\nitinerary planning problem is one of the problems included in \\nthat category. Therefore, in this research, we will develop an \\napplication  to  solve  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem \\nusing artificial intelligence approach. \\n\\nIn this study, the developed application should be able to \\nprovide  an  optimal  itinerary  recommendation  in  terms  of \\ndistance  and  travel  time.  We  use  initial  assumption  that  the \\ntraveler  has  determined  all  the  tourist  destinations  he/she \\nwants to visit and also the number of days he/she will stay in \\nthe region. There are two sub-issues to solve. The first is how \\nto cluster the tourist destinations that will be visited for each \\nday. While the second is how to arrange the order of visits on \\na  daily  basis  so  that  the  total  travel  distance  will  be \\nminimum. \\n\\nThe  problem  of  grouping  the  visited  tourist  destinations \\nin each day can be solved by employing k-means clustering, \\nwhere  the  nearby  tourist  destinations  will  be  grouped  to  be \\nvisited  on  the  same  day.  While  the  problem  of  optimization \\nof  the  visit  order (tour  arrangement)  can  be  solved  by  using \\nthe traveling salesman problem (TSP) approach. \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\nTSP  can  simply  be  stated  as:  if  a  traveling  salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\n)  and  then \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. In this study, salesman can \\nbe  analogized  as  a  traveler  and  the  visited  cities  are  tourist \\ndestinations  in a region. We use Yogyakarta city, one of the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nWith the technique proposed in this study, it is expected that \\nthe  application  prototype  will  be  able  to  help  traveler  in \\narranging a better travel  itinerary, which  is  more efficient  in \\nterms of distance and travel time. \\n\\nThe  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 \\ntraveling  salesman \\ndescribes  some  preliminaries  about \\nproblem,  k-means  clustering,  and  review  on  travel  itinerary \\nplanning  application.  Section  3  describes  the  methodology. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cSection  4  describes  the  results.  Finally,  the  conclusion  and \\nfuture work are described in section 5.', 'II.': \"II. \\n\\nPRELIMINARIES \\n\\nA.  Traveling Salesman Problem \\n\\nin  graph \\n\\nTraveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  one  of  the  most \\nfamous  problems \\ntheory  and  combinatorics. \\nMathematical  problems  related  to  the  TSP  were  firstly \\nintroduced  in  the  1800s  by  the  Irish  mathematician  Sir \\nWilliam  Rowan  Hamilton  and  by  the  British  mathematician \\nThomas  Penyngton  Kirkman  [4].  TSP  is  an  optimization \\nproblem and can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\n)  and  then \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. According to graph theory, \\ncity  can  be  represented  as  a  graph  node,  while  the  road that \\nconnects between two cities can be represented as edge. The \\nedge's weight represents the distance between two cities. TSP \\nis  none  other than  determining  the  Hamilton  circuit that  has \\nthe  minimum  weight  on  a  connected  graph.  The  Hamilton \\ncircuit itself is a closed path that pass each node/vertex in the \\ngraph exactly once, except the origin node (which is also the \\nfinal node) that is passed twice. \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  vertices \\n\\nComputationally,  TSP  has  high  time  complexity.  In  any \\ncomplete  graph  with \\n,  the  number  of \\n. We can imagine if \\ndifferent Hamilton circuits is \\nthe  number  of  vertices  to  be  visited  are  very  huge, the  time \\nneeded  to  evaluate  the  possible  solutions  (to obtain  the  best \\nsolution)  will  be  very \\nlong.  Therefore,  beside  using \\ndeterministic  methods,  many  studies  have  developed \\nmethods  for  solving  TSP  using  heuristic  methods  such  as \\ngenetic algorithms [5][6] or swarm intelligence [7][8]. \\n\\nIn  a  case  of  TSP  with  small  number  of  vertices,  a  brute \\nforce (exhaustive enumeration) approach can be used to find \\nthe  order  of  visits  with  a  minimum  total  distance.  Figure  1 \\nshows an example of a TSP case with 4 vertices and also the \\nsolution using brute force method. \\n\\nFig. 1. The example of TSP \\n\\nB.  K-Means Clustering \\n\\nK-means  is  an  algorithm  used  for  clustering  which  will \\ndivide data into several groups. K-means algorithm is one of \\nthe  non-hierarchical  clustering  methods  that  can  group  data \\ninto  several  groups  based  on  similarity  of  data.  This \\nmechanism  allows  data  that  have  the  same  characteristics \\ngrouped  into  one  cluster  and  data  that  have  different \\ncharacteristics grouped in other clusters. \\n\\nthat  can  be  used \\n\\nTo  determine  the  cluster  label  of  the  data,  the  distance \\nbetween data with each cluster center is calculated. There are \\nto  perform  distance \\nseveral  ways \\ncalculations, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, \\nand  Chebichey  distance.  The  k-means  method  aims  to \\nminimize  the  sum  of  squares  of  distance  between  all  data \\npoints  with  the  center  of  each  cluster.  The  procedure  of  k-\\nmeans consists of the following steps, as described in [9]. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 1: Select \\n\\n out of the given \\ncluster  centers.  Assign  each  of  the  remaining \\npatterns to one of the \\nits closest center/cluster. \\n\\n clusters; a pattern is assigned to \\n\\n patterns as the initial \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 2: Compute the cluster centers based on the current \\n\\nassignment of patterns. \\n\\uf0b7  Step  3:  Assign  each  of  the \\n\\ncenter/cluster. \\n\\n  patterns  to  its  closest \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step  4:  If  there  is  no  change  in  the  assignment  of \\npatterns  to  clusters  during  two  successive  iterations, \\nthen stop; else, go to Step 2. \\n\\nK-means  algorithm  has  several  advantages  such  as \\nsimple, fast, and easy to implement. Nevertheless, the output \\nof  k-means  relies  heavily  on  a  randomly  determined  initial \\ncentroid.  Therefore,  in  practical  applications  k-means  must \\nbe  run  several  times  with  different  initial  centroids  to \\nproduce the final centroid that is considered the best. \\n\\nC.  Preview on Travel Itinerary Planning Application \\n\\nWith  the  growing  capabilities  in  technology  nowadays, \\nthere  are  many  research  and  applications  to  facilitate  the \\ntravelers  [10].  Most  of  them  are  applications  that  provide \\nrecommendations  and  reviews  about  destinations  of  interest \\nto  visit,  such  as  TripAdvisor  application.  There  are  still \\nrarely founded applications that can be used where the case is \\nuser has determined the destinations that he/she wants to visit \\nand  begin  to  arrange  or  schedule  the  order  automatically. \\nUsually  the  prospective  travelers  must  arrange  their  own \\nschedule  and  then  record  it  in  the  applications  that  can  help \\nthem keep the itinerary records. \\n\\nBased  on  references  found  on  the  Internet,  one  of  the \\nitinerary  planner  application  is  Eightydays  which  is  an \\napplication that helps travelers to design a travel plan to visit \\nseveral  cities  in  Europe  [11].  This  app  gives  tourists  some \\navailable  options  when  going  on  a  trip  to  Europe.  The  app \\ndeveloper  realizes  that  arranging  travel  plan  manually  is \\nusually  time  consuming.  By  using  Eightydays,  user  only \\nneeds to enter a city where the journey will begin and finish. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThen  user  must  also  enter the  date of  departure, duration  of \\ntravel  and  the  number  of  cities  they  want  to  visit.  The  app \\nitinerary  along  with  flight \\nwill  automatically  generate \\ninformation and accommodation information in each city. \\n\\nEightydays  is  considered  as  macro  planner,  which  plans \\nvisit to several cities. Whereas in one city alone tourists still \\nneed to make  itinerary. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to develop \\nadditional  applications  that  can  solve  this  problem,  so  that \\nprospective travelers no longer spend a lot of time to design \\nan efficient itinerary. \\n\\ntour  planner  system \\n\\nAnother  more  sophisticated \\n\\nis \\nDynamic Tour Guide (DTG) [12]. Points of interest in DTG \\nare called as Tour Building Blocks (TBBs) and described by \\nontology.  DTG  calculates  the  similarity  between  TBBs  and \\nuser  profile  to  select  which  point of  interest the user  should \\nvisit during his/her stay. In our approach, the user can select \\nthe  points  of  interest  which  he/she  wish  to  visit,  then  the \\npoints of interest will be clustered for each day planning.\", 'III.  METHODOLOGY': 'III.  METHODOLOGY \\n\\nIn  this  study,  we  choose  Yogyakarta  city,  one  of  the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nYogyakarta  has  a  lot  of  tourism  destinations.  Moreover, \\nbased  on  statistical  data  of  Yogyakarta  Province  Tourism \\nOffice [13], the number of tourists continues to increase from \\n2012 to 2016, as can be seen in Figure 2. This trend indicates \\nthat  in  the  future  Yogyakarta  will  attract  more travelers.  To \\nencourage  the  development  of  Yogyakarta  as  a  tourist \\ndestination, \\nthe \\ngovernment  but  also  by  the  creative  industry  sector  such  as \\nsoftware industry. \\n\\nit  should  be  supported  not  only  by \\n\\nFig. 2. Statistical data of tourists visiting Yogyakarta from 2012 to 2016. \\n\\nPrior  to  modeling  the  system,  we  performed  a  system \\nrequirement  analysis.  We  identify  some  inputs  required  by \\nthe  application.  They  are  the  number  of  days  desired  for  a \\nvacation,  the  starting  location  of  the  trip  and  also  the \\ndestination  locations  that  user  wants  to  visit.  In  this  initial \\nversion of the app, it is assumed that the initial  location and \\nthe  final  location  of  the  trip  are  the  same,  which  is  in \\n\\naccordance with the TSP concept. This location can be filled \\nwith  the  address  where  user  will  stay  in  the  tourist \\ndestination  city.  The  app  will  also  provide  a  list  of  tourist \\ndestination  locations  (points  of  interest)  that  can  be  visited, \\nso user only needs to choose from the existing list. In making \\nthis application, the database  for the list of points of  interest \\nis taken from YogYes.com which is a website travel portal to \\nYogyakarta. \\n\\nThe  system  framework  is  presented  in  Figure  3.  Our \\napproach  consists  of  two  main  modules,  the  first  one  is \\nclustering  module  using  k-means  method.  All  destination \\nlocations  preferred  by  user  will  be  grouped  into \\n  cluster \\nwith  the  number  of \\n  equals  with  the  number  of  vacation \\ndays.  Second  one  is  finding  TSP  solution  using  all  possible \\npermutations. \\n\\nFig. 3. Framework System  \\n\\nSome  processes  that  need  to  be  done  by  the  application \\nare the  process of  accessing  the  location  that the user  wants \\nas  the  initial  location  of  the  itinerary,  the  process  of \\ndisplaying the list of points of interest, the process of making \\nitinerary, and the process of displaying itinerary result. In the \\nend, user can download the itinerary result in the form of .pdf \\nfile  in  order  to  make  it  easier  to  print  or  save  the  itinerary \\nresult on other devices. \\n\\nThe next step is modeling the system. System modeling is \\nmade  using  flowchart  diagram  to  describe  the  algorithm  or \\nthe  steps  of  problem  solving.  The  general  system  flowchart \\ncan be seen in Figure 3. \\n\\nFigure  4  illustrates  the  flow  of  the  travel  itinerary \\nplanning  application.  The  process  begins  by  entering  the \\nnumber of vacation days, the starting location of the trip and \\nthe  destination  locations  to  be  visited.  After  system  gets  the \\ninputs, the next step is to make the itinerary. The final step is \\nto display the travel itinerary recommendation based on TSP \\nsolution  approach  and  k-means  clustering.  The  process  of \\n“make itinerary” is described in more detail in Figure 4. \\n\\nFigure 5 shows the detail process for getting a travel route. \\nFirst of all, start by grouping the tourist destination locations \\nby  day.  This  grouping  uses  k-means  clustering  algorithm, \\nwhere  the  number  of  days  on  vacation  will  be  used  as  the \\nvalue  of  k  (number  of  clusters).  With  k-means  clustering \\ntechnique, the  nearby tourist destinations will  be  grouped to \\nbe visited on the same day. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cthat  has  the  smallest  total  distance  for  each  cluster.  This \\npermutation results are considered as the itinerary. From this \\nresult, the itinerary will be visualized into Google Maps.', 'IV.  RESULT': \"IV.  RESULT \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  application  is  implemented \\nas a web-based application. The application interface consists \\nof two pages, the main page and the itinerary page. The main \\npage  is  used  to  get  input  from  user.  On  this  page,  user  can \\ndetermine  the  number  of  days  of  vacation,  determine  the \\nstarting location of the trip, and determine the desired tourist \\ndestinations.  The  number  of  the  desired  destination  to  visit \\ncan  be  more  than  one  destination  location.  Figure  5  shows \\nthe example of implementation result from the main page. \\n\\nIn  the  example  below,  user  inputs  3  days  as  the  number \\nof days on vacation, fills in the initial location of the trip and \\nchooses  7  points  of  interest.  After  all  the  required  data  has \\nbeen entered, the data will  be processed using the algorithm \\nas  described  in  section  3  of  this  paper.  User  has  to  wait  a \\nwhile to get the result of the itinerary design from the system. \\nAn example of the itinerary result can be seen in Figure 6-9. \\n\\nFig. 4. Flowchart system. \\n\\nFig. 5. Detail of “make itinerary” process. \\n\\nThe  next  step  is  to  apply  the  TSP  approach  to  find  the \\nmost  efficient  order  of  visits  for  each  day.  The  process  is \\ndone  by  searching  all  possible  permutations  of  the  order  of \\nvisits to all tourist destinations belonging to the same cluster. \\nHaving  obtained  the  results  of  all  possible  permutations  of \\nthe  order  of  visits,  then  the  next  process  is  to  take  the \\ndistance  between  destinations  based  on  data  obtained  from \\nthe  Google  Maps  API.  To  accelerate  this  process,  the \\ndistance  between  destinations  is  stored  in  the  system \\ndatabase.  Once  obtained  the  distance,  then  calculate  the \\nlength of the circuit path (which  is obtained  by summing up \\nall the distance traveled to visit all the destination locations) \\nfor each possible permutation in each cluster. The last, select \\nthe  permutation  result  (which  represent  the  order  of  visits) \\n\\nFig. 6. The main page. \\n\\nFigure 7 shows the itinerary recommendation for the first \\nday,  Figure  8  for the  second  day,  and  Figure  9  for the  third \\nday. If we analyze the result of the itinerary recommendation, \\nwe find that the places visited for each day are located close \\nto  each  other.  This  result  indicates  that  k-means  clustering \\nalgorithm  runs  correctly.  On  the  first  day,  user  gets \\nrecommendation  to  visit  3  tourist  attractions  located  in \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cYogyakarta's  city  center.  On \\nis \\nrecommended  to  visit  2  sights  located  in  the  north-west  of \\nYogyakarta city, while on the third day it is recommended to \\nvisit 2 sights located in the east area of Yogyakarta. \\n\\nthe  second  day \\n\\nit \\n\\nFig. 7.

On  the \\nitinerary  page,  in  addition  to  the  map  presented,  also \\npresented  the  information  about  the  estimated  total  distance \\nand  travel  time  on  the  right  side  of  the  map,  as  well  as  the \\ndetailed  information  about  tour  arrangement.  User  is  also \\nprovided  a  link  to  access  directions  between  locations  that \\naim to facilitate the user in traveling between two locations. \\nWe obtain the location directions data from the Google Maps \\nAPI.  Finally,  to  facilitate  the  documentation,  user  can  save \\nand  download  the  results of  the  itinerary  design  in  the  form \\nof a .pdf file. \\n\\nIn  this  experiment,  we  tried  to  calculate  and  analyze  the \\nprocessing time of the application. For each scenario, we run \\nit  three  times  then  calculated  the  average  value  of  the \\nprocessing time. Although the scenario is same, the length of \\nprocessing time may vary as it is influenced by several factors \\nsuch  as  internet  connection  speed,  memory,  and  also  server \\nprocessor  speed.  Unstable  internet  connection  will  greatly \\naffect  the  long  of  system's  processing  time.  The  results \\nobtained can be seen in Table 1. \\n\\nTABLE 1.

This \\ncan  happen  because  with  the  increasing  number  of  tourist \\ndestinations, will prolong the clustering process. In addition, \\nif the members of each cluster are larger, then the process of \\ndetermining TSP solutions will also be longer. Nevertheless, \\nin  the  real  world,  usually  a  traveler  will  not  visit  too  many \\npoints  of  interest  in  a  day.  By  considering  that  fact,  the \\nrunning  time  of  this  application  can  still  be  accepted  by  the \\nuser. For the future, the algorithm, especially the algorithm to \\nfind the solution of the order of visits needs to be  improved \\nto get faster run time.\", 'V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK': 'V.

       " 'I.': 'I. \\n\\n INTRODUCTION \\n\\nItinerary is a planned route or journey. For travelers, travel \\nitinerary  usually  contains  a  schedule of  intended  destinations \\nand  activities.  After  selecting  the  tourist  destinations  to  be \\nvisited, the process of arranging the travel tour route (making \\nitinerary) becomes the next challenging problem to be solved. \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  is  unstructured  in \\nreal  life,  which  means  goals,  decision  criteria  and  other \\nconstrains  of \\nto  completely \\nthe  problem  are  unable \\npredefined [1]. However, we can identify and define some of \\nthe problems that travelers often encounter when  making an \\nitinerary. One of them is when the traveler is not familiar or \\nlack of information about the locations he/she wants to visit, \\nthen he/she must look for the tourist destination locations one \\nby  one  to  estimate  the  order of  the  visit.  The  searching  and \\nmapping  process  itself  certainly  can  take  a  long  time. \\nMoreover, if the traveler decides to spend more than one day \\nin  the  destination  city,  then  he/she  must  also  determine  the \\nschedule of tourist visits for each day. \\n\\n Recent  years,  many  computer-based  applications  are \\nutilizing  artificial  intelligence  (AI).  Russell  and  Norvig  [2] \\ncategorized  the  definitions  of  AI  into  four  categories: \\n\\nsystems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, \\nsystems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally. \\nSome  of  the  problems  that  are  often  solved  using  AI  is \\noptimization  and  decision  making  problem.  The  travel \\nitinerary planning problem is one of the problems included in \\nthat category. Therefore, in this research, we will develop an \\napplication  to  solve  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem \\nusing artificial intelligence approach. \\n\\nIn this study, the developed application should be able to \\nprovide  an  optimal  itinerary  recommendation  in  terms  of \\ndistance  and  travel  time.  We  use  initial  assumption  that  the \\ntraveler  has  determined  all  the  tourist  destinations  he/she \\nwants to visit and also the number of days he/she will stay in \\nthe region. There are two sub-issues to solve. The first is how \\nto cluster the tourist destinations that will be visited for each \\nday. While the second is how to arrange the order of visits on \\na  daily  basis  so  that  the  total  travel  distance  will  be \\nminimum. \\n\\nThe  problem  of  grouping  the  visited  tourist  destinations \\nin each day can be solved by employing k-means clustering, \\nwhere  the  nearby  tourist  destinations  will  be  grouped  to  be \\nvisited  on  the  same  day.  While  the  problem  of  optimization \\nof  the  visit  order (tour  arrangement)  can  be  solved  by  using \\nthe traveling salesman problem (TSP) approach. \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\nTSP  can  simply  be  stated  as:  if  a  traveling  salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\n)  and  then \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. In this study, salesman can \\nbe  analogized  as  a  traveler  and  the  visited  cities  are  tourist \\ndestinations  in a region. We use Yogyakarta city, one of the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nWith the technique proposed in this study, it is expected that \\nthe  application  prototype  will  be  able  to  help  traveler  in \\narranging a better travel  itinerary, which  is  more efficient  in \\nterms of distance and travel time. \\n\\nThe  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2 \\ntraveling  salesman \\ndescribes  some  preliminaries  about \\nproblem,  k-means  clustering,  and  review  on  travel  itinerary \\nplanning  application.  Section  3  describes  the  methodology. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\x0cSection  4  describes  the  results.  Finally,  the  conclusion  and \\nfuture work are described in section 5.',\n",
       " 'II.': \"II. \\n\\nPRELIMINARIES \\n\\nA.  Traveling Salesman Problem \\n\\nin  graph \\n\\nTraveling  salesman  problem  (TSP)  is  one  of  the  most \\nfamous  problems \\ntheory  and  combinatorics. \\nMathematical  problems  related  to  the  TSP  were  firstly \\nintroduced  in  the  1800s  by  the  Irish  mathematician  Sir \\nWilliam  Rowan  Hamilton  and  by  the  British  mathematician \\nThomas  Penyngton  Kirkman  [4].  TSP  is  an  optimization \\nproblem and can simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman \\n cities (where \\nwishes to visit exactly once each of a list of \\n)  and  then \\nthe  cost  of  traveling  from  city \\nreturn  to  home  city,  what  is  the  least  costly  route  the \\ntraveling salesman can take? [3]. According to graph theory, \\ncity  can  be  represented  as  a  graph  node,  while  the  road that \\nconnects between two cities can be represented as edge. The \\nedge's weight represents the distance between two cities. TSP \\nis  none  other than  determining  the  Hamilton  circuit that  has \\nthe  minimum  weight  on  a  connected  graph.  The  Hamilton \\ncircuit itself is a closed path that pass each node/vertex in the \\ngraph exactly once, except the origin node (which is also the \\nfinal node) that is passed twice. \\n\\n  to  city \\n\\n  is \\n\\n  vertices \\n\\nComputationally,  TSP  has  high  time  complexity.  In  any \\ncomplete  graph  with \\n,  the  number  of \\n. We can imagine if \\ndifferent Hamilton circuits is \\nthe  number  of  vertices  to  be  visited  are  very  huge, the  time \\nneeded  to  evaluate  the  possible  solutions  (to obtain  the  best \\nsolution)  will  be  very \\nlong.  Therefore,  beside  using \\ndeterministic  methods,  many  studies  have  developed \\nmethods  for  solving  TSP  using  heuristic  methods  such  as \\ngenetic algorithms [5][6] or swarm intelligence [7][8]. \\n\\nIn  a  case  of  TSP  with  small  number  of  vertices,  a  brute \\nforce (exhaustive enumeration) approach can be used to find \\nthe  order  of  visits  with  a  minimum  total  distance.  Figure  1 \\nshows an example of a TSP case with 4 vertices and also the \\nsolution using brute force method. \\n\\nFig. 1. The example of TSP \\n\\nB.  K-Means Clustering \\n\\nK-means  is  an  algorithm  used  for  clustering  which  will \\ndivide data into several groups. K-means algorithm is one of \\nthe  non-hierarchical  clustering  methods  that  can  group  data \\ninto  several  groups  based  on  similarity  of  data.  This \\nmechanism  allows  data  that  have  the  same  characteristics \\ngrouped  into  one  cluster  and  data  that  have  different \\ncharacteristics grouped in other clusters. \\n\\nthat  can  be  used \\n\\nTo  determine  the  cluster  label  of  the  data,  the  distance \\nbetween data with each cluster center is calculated. There are \\nto  perform  distance \\nseveral  ways \\ncalculations, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, \\nand  Chebichey  distance.  The  k-means  method  aims  to \\nminimize  the  sum  of  squares  of  distance  between  all  data \\npoints  with  the  center  of  each  cluster.  The  procedure  of  k-\\nmeans consists of the following steps, as described in [9]. \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 1: Select \\n\\n out of the given \\ncluster  centers.  Assign  each  of  the  remaining \\npatterns to one of the \\nits closest center/cluster. \\n\\n clusters; a pattern is assigned to \\n\\n patterns as the initial \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step 2: Compute the cluster centers based on the current \\n\\nassignment of patterns. \\n\\uf0b7  Step  3:  Assign  each  of  the \\n\\ncenter/cluster. \\n\\n  patterns  to  its  closest \\n\\n\\uf0b7  Step  4:  If  there  is  no  change  in  the  assignment  of \\npatterns  to  clusters  during  two  successive  iterations, \\nthen stop; else, go to Step 2. \\n\\nK-means  algorithm  has  several  advantages  such  as \\nsimple, fast, and easy to implement. Nevertheless, the output \\nof  k-means  relies  heavily  on  a  randomly  determined  initial \\ncentroid.  Therefore,  in  practical  applications  k-means  must \\nbe  run  several  times  with  different  initial  centroids  to \\nproduce the final centroid that is considered the best. \\n\\nC.  Preview on Travel Itinerary Planning Application \\n\\nWith  the  growing  capabilities  in  technology  nowadays, \\nthere  are  many  research  and  applications  to  facilitate  the \\ntravelers  [10].  Most  of  them  are  applications  that  provide \\nrecommendations  and  reviews  about  destinations  of  interest \\nto  visit,  such  as  TripAdvisor  application.  There  are  still \\nrarely founded applications that can be used where the case is \\nuser has determined the destinations that he/she wants to visit \\nand  begin  to  arrange  or  schedule  the  order  automatically. \\nUsually  the  prospective  travelers  must  arrange  their  own \\nschedule  and  then  record  it  in  the  applications  that  can  help \\nthem keep the itinerary records. \\n\\nBased  on  references  found  on  the  Internet,  one  of  the \\nitinerary  planner  application  is  Eightydays  which  is  an \\napplication that helps travelers to design a travel plan to visit \\nseveral  cities  in  Europe  [11].  This  app  gives  tourists  some \\navailable  options  when  going  on  a  trip  to  Europe.  The  app \\ndeveloper  realizes  that  arranging  travel  plan  manually  is \\nusually  time  consuming.  By  using  Eightydays,  user  only \\nneeds to enter a city where the journey will begin and finish. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThen  user  must  also  enter the  date of  departure, duration  of \\ntravel  and  the  number  of  cities  they  want  to  visit.  The  app \\nitinerary  along  with  flight \\nwill  automatically  generate \\ninformation and accommodation information in each city. \\n\\nEightydays  is  considered  as  macro  planner,  which  plans \\nvisit to several cities. Whereas in one city alone tourists still \\nneed to make  itinerary. Therefore, it  is  necessary  to develop \\nadditional  applications  that  can  solve  this  problem,  so  that \\nprospective travelers no longer spend a lot of time to design \\nan efficient itinerary. \\n\\ntour  planner  system \\n\\nAnother  more  sophisticated \\n\\nis \\nDynamic Tour Guide (DTG) [12]. Points of interest in DTG \\nare called as Tour Building Blocks (TBBs) and described by \\nontology.  DTG  calculates  the  similarity  between  TBBs  and \\nuser  profile  to  select  which  point of  interest the user  should \\nvisit during his/her stay. In our approach, the user can select \\nthe  points  of  interest  which  he/she  wish  to  visit,  then  the \\npoints of interest will be clustered for each day planning.\",\n",
       " 'III.  METHODOLOGY': 'III.  METHODOLOGY \\n\\nIn  this  study,  we  choose  Yogyakarta  city,  one  of  the \\ntourist city  in Indonesia, as an example to illustrate how the \\nproposed  algorithm  can  help  travelers  make  their  itinerary. \\nYogyakarta  has  a  lot  of  tourism  destinations.  Moreover, \\nbased  on  statistical  data  of  Yogyakarta  Province  Tourism \\nOffice [13], the number of tourists continues to increase from \\n2012 to 2016, as can be seen in Figure 2. This trend indicates \\nthat  in  the  future  Yogyakarta  will  attract  more travelers.  To \\nencourage  the  development  of  Yogyakarta  as  a  tourist \\ndestination, \\nthe \\ngovernment  but  also  by  the  creative  industry  sector  such  as \\nsoftware industry. \\n\\nit  should  be  supported  not  only  by \\n\\nFig. 2. Statistical data of tourists visiting Yogyakarta from 2012 to 2016. \\n\\nPrior  to  modeling  the  system,  we  performed  a  system \\nrequirement  analysis.  We  identify  some  inputs  required  by \\nthe  application.  They  are  the  number  of  days  desired  for  a \\nvacation,  the  starting  location  of  the  trip  and  also  the \\ndestination  locations  that  user  wants  to  visit.  In  this  initial \\nversion of the app, it is assumed that the initial  location and \\nthe  final  location  of  the  trip  are  the  same,  which  is  in \\n\\naccordance with the TSP concept. This location can be filled \\nwith  the  address  where  user  will  stay  in  the  tourist \\ndestination  city.  The  app  will  also  provide  a  list  of  tourist \\ndestination  locations  (points  of  interest)  that  can  be  visited, \\nso user only needs to choose from the existing list. In making \\nthis application, the database  for the list of points of  interest \\nis taken from YogYes.com which is a website travel portal to \\nYogyakarta. \\n\\nThe  system  framework  is  presented  in  Figure  3.  Our \\napproach  consists  of  two  main  modules,  the  first  one  is \\nclustering  module  using  k-means  method.  All  destination \\nlocations  preferred  by  user  will  be  grouped  into \\n  cluster \\nwith  the  number  of \\n  equals  with  the  number  of  vacation \\ndays.  Second  one  is  finding  TSP  solution  using  all  possible \\npermutations. \\n\\nFig. 3. Framework System  \\n\\nSome  processes  that  need  to  be  done  by  the  application \\nare the  process of  accessing  the  location  that the user  wants \\nas  the  initial  location  of  the  itinerary,  the  process  of \\ndisplaying the list of points of interest, the process of making \\nitinerary, and the process of displaying itinerary result. In the \\nend, user can download the itinerary result in the form of .pdf \\nfile  in  order  to  make  it  easier  to  print  or  save  the  itinerary \\nresult on other devices. \\n\\nThe next step is modeling the system. System modeling is \\nmade  using  flowchart  diagram  to  describe  the  algorithm  or \\nthe  steps  of  problem  solving.  The  general  system  flowchart \\ncan be seen in Figure 3. \\n\\nFigure  4  illustrates  the  flow  of  the  travel  itinerary \\nplanning  application.  The  process  begins  by  entering  the \\nnumber of vacation days, the starting location of the trip and \\nthe  destination  locations  to  be  visited.  After  system  gets  the \\ninputs, the next step is to make the itinerary. The final step is \\nto display the travel itinerary recommendation based on TSP \\nsolution  approach  and  k-means  clustering.  The  process  of \\n“make itinerary” is described in more detail in Figure 4. \\n\\nFigure 5 shows the detail process for getting a travel route. \\nFirst of all, start by grouping the tourist destination locations \\nby  day.  This  grouping  uses  k-means  clustering  algorithm, \\nwhere  the  number  of  days  on  vacation  will  be  used  as  the \\nvalue  of  k  (number  of  clusters).  With  k-means  clustering \\ntechnique, the  nearby tourist destinations will  be  grouped to \\nbe visited on the same day. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cthat  has  the  smallest  total  distance  for  each  cluster.  This \\npermutation results are considered as the itinerary. From this \\nresult, the itinerary will be visualized into Google Maps.',\n",
       " 'IV.  RESULT': \"IV.  RESULT \\n\\nThe  travel  itinerary  planning  application  is  implemented \\nas a web-based application. The application interface consists \\nof two pages, the main page and the itinerary page. The main \\npage  is  used  to  get  input  from  user.  On  this  page,  user  can \\ndetermine  the  number  of  days  of  vacation,  determine  the \\nstarting location of the trip, and determine the desired tourist \\ndestinations.  The  number  of  the  desired  destination  to  visit \\ncan  be  more  than  one  destination  location.  Figure  5  shows \\nthe example of implementation result from the main page. \\n\\nIn  the  example  below,  user  inputs  3  days  as  the  number \\nof days on vacation, fills in the initial location of the trip and \\nchooses  7  points  of  interest.  After  all  the  required  data  has \\nbeen entered, the data will  be processed using the algorithm \\nas  described  in  section  3  of  this  paper.  User  has  to  wait  a \\nwhile to get the result of the itinerary design from the system. \\nAn example of the itinerary result can be seen in Figure 6-9. \\n\\nFig. 4. Flowchart system. \\n\\nFig. 5. Detail of “make itinerary” process. \\n\\nThe  next  step  is  to  apply  the  TSP  approach  to  find  the \\nmost  efficient  order  of  visits  for  each  day.  The  process  is \\ndone  by  searching  all  possible  permutations  of  the  order  of \\nvisits to all tourist destinations belonging to the same cluster. \\nHaving  obtained  the  results  of  all  possible  permutations  of \\nthe  order  of  visits,  then  the  next  process  is  to  take  the \\ndistance  between  destinations  based  on  data  obtained  from \\nthe  Google  Maps  API.  To  accelerate  this  process,  the \\ndistance  between  destinations  is  stored  in  the  system \\ndatabase.  Once  obtained  the  distance,  then  calculate  the \\nlength of the circuit path (which  is obtained  by summing up \\nall the distance traveled to visit all the destination locations) \\nfor each possible permutation in each cluster. The last, select \\nthe  permutation  result  (which  represent  the  order  of  visits) \\n\\nFig. 6. The main page. \\n\\nFigure 7 shows the itinerary recommendation for the first \\nday,  Figure  8  for the  second  day,  and  Figure  9  for the  third \\nday. If we analyze the result of the itinerary recommendation, \\nwe find that the places visited for each day are located close \\nto  each  other.  This  result  indicates  that  k-means  clustering \\nalgorithm  runs  correctly.  On  the  first  day,  user  gets \\nrecommendation  to  visit  3  tourist  attractions  located  in \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cYogyakarta's  city  center.  On \\nis \\nrecommended  to  visit  2  sights  located  in  the  north-west  of \\nYogyakarta city, while on the third day it is recommended to \\nvisit 2 sights located in the east area of Yogyakarta. \\n\\nthe  second  day \\n\\nit \\n\\nFig. 7.

On  the \\nitinerary  page,  in  addition  to  the  map  presented,  also \\npresented  the  information  about  the  estimated  total  distance \\nand  travel  time  on  the  right  side  of  the  map,  as  well  as  the \\ndetailed  information  about  tour  arrangement.  User  is  also \\nprovided  a  link  to  access  directions  between  locations  that \\naim to facilitate the user in traveling between two locations. \\nWe obtain the location directions data from the Google Maps \\nAPI.  Finally,  to  facilitate  the  documentation,  user  can  save \\nand  download  the  results of  the  itinerary  design  in  the  form \\nof a .pdf file. \\n\\nIn  this  experiment,  we  tried  to  calculate  and  analyze  the \\nprocessing time of the application. For each scenario, we run \\nit  three  times  then  calculated  the  average  value  of  the \\nprocessing time. Although the scenario is same, the length of \\nprocessing time may vary as it is influenced by several factors \\nsuch  as  internet  connection  speed,  memory,  and  also  server \\nprocessor  speed.  Unstable  internet  connection  will  greatly \\naffect  the  long  of  system's  processing  time.  The  results \\nobtained can be seen in Table 1. \\n\\nTABLE 1.

This \\ncan  happen  because  with  the  increasing  number  of  tourist \\ndestinations, will prolong the clustering process. In addition, \\nif the members of each cluster are larger, then the process of \\ndetermining TSP solutions will also be longer.

By  considering  that  fact,  the \\nrunning  time  of  this  application  can  still  be  accepted  by  the \\nuser.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \\n\\nIn  this  paper,  traveling  salesman  problem  and  k-means \\nclustering approach has been applied to develop an automatic \\ntravel \\nitinerary  planning  application.  By  using  our \\napplication,  it  can  help  traveler  in  arranging  a  smart  travel \\nitinerary,  which  is  efficient  in  terms  of  distance  and  travel \\ntime.  However,  we  realize  that  this  application  still  need \\nmany  improvement,  since  the  goals,  decision  criteria  and \\nother  constrains  of  the  travel  itinerary  planning  problem  are \\nunable  to  completely  predefined.  In  the  future,  in  order  to \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cimprove our algorithm, we plan to conduct User Acceptance \\nTesting to gather feedback from prospective user. \\n\\nproblem.
